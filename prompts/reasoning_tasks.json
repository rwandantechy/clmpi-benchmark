      "prompt": "A train travels 120 miles in 2 hours. If it continues at the same speed, how long will it take to travel 300 miles?",
      "expected_answer": "5 hours. The train travels at 60 mph (120 miles / 2 hours). To travel 300 miles at 60 mph: 300 / 60 = 5 hours.",

      "prompt": "Why do leaves change color in the fall? Explain the scientific process.",
      "expected_answer": "Leaves change color because chlorophyll production decreases as days get shorter and temperatures drop. This reveals other pigments like carotenoids (yellow/orange) and anthocyanins (red/purple) that were masked by the green chlorophyll.",
