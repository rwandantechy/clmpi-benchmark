# Principled Dataset Selection for CLMPI Framework

## Overview

This document outlines the principled approach to dataset selection for the CLMPI framework, using well-established academic and industrial benchmarks that are widely recognized in LLM research.

## Dataset Selection Criteria

### 1. Academic Credibility
- Published in peer-reviewed conferences/journals
- Widely cited in the research community
- Clear methodology and validation procedures

### 2. Benchmark Standards
- Established evaluation protocols
- Reproducible results
- Clear scoring mechanisms

### 3. Real-World Relevance
- Practical applications
- Industry adoption
- Continuous community validation

## Selected Benchmarks by Category

### Accuracy: GSM8K (Grade School Math Word Problems)
- **Source**: Cobbe, K., et al. (2021). Training Verifiers to Solve Math Word Problems. arXiv:2110.14168
- **Rationale**: Mathematical reasoning is fundamental to factual accuracy
- **Question Type**: Multi-step word problems requiring logical reasoning
- **Example**: "Janet's dogs eat 2 pounds of dog food each day. Janet has 5 dogs. How many pounds of dog food does Janet need to feed her dogs for 30 days?"

### Contextual Understanding: SQuAD (Stanford Question Answering Dataset)
- **Source**: Rajpurkar, P., et al. (2016). SQuAD: 100,000+ Questions for Machine Comprehension of Text. EMNLP 2016
- **Rationale**: Passage comprehension is essential for contextual understanding
- **Question Type**: Span-based question answering from passages
- **Example**: Context about Eiffel Tower construction, question about original purpose

### Coherence: HellaSwag (Harder Endings for Language Models)
- **Source**: Zellers, R., et al. (2019). HellaSwag: Can a Machine Really Finish Your Sentence? ACL 2019
- **Rationale**: Sentence completion tests logical flow and coherence
- **Question Type**: Sentence continuation with multiple choice endings
- **Example**: "A person is cooking in the kitchen. They are preparing a meal and following a recipe. The person carefully measures ingredients and follows each step. Next,"

### Fluency: CoLA (Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability)
- **Source**: Warstadt, A., et al. (2019). Neural Network Acceptability Judgments. TACL 2019
- **Rationale**: Grammatical acceptability is fundamental to fluency
- **Question Type**: Grammatical acceptability judgments
- **Example**: Write grammatically correct sentences about education importance

### Performance Efficiency: Coherence Task Performance Measurement
- **Source**: CLMPI Framework Methodology
- **Rationale**: Measure performance metrics during coherence evaluation
- **Method**: Performance monitoring during HellaSwag sentence completion tasks
- **Metrics**: Latency, CPU usage, memory consumption during generation

## Implementation Benefits

### 1. Credibility
- Results comparable to published research
- Established baseline performance
- Peer-reviewed methodology

### 2. Reproducibility
- Clear evaluation protocols
- Standardized scoring methods
- Version-controlled datasets

### 3. Extensibility
- Easy to add more questions from same benchmarks
- Framework supports multiple datasets per category
- Modular design for new benchmarks

## Dataset Versioning

### Version 2.0.0 Changes
- Replaced custom questions with benchmark questions
- Added source attribution and references
- Standardized question format across categories
- Reduced to one question per category for focused evaluation

### Future Versions
- Multiple questions per benchmark
- Additional benchmark sources
- Domain-specific evaluations
- Multi-language support

## Usage Guidelines

### 1. Citation Requirements
When using CLMPI results, cite both:
- CLMPI framework methodology
- Original benchmark papers

### 2. Result Interpretation
- Compare against published benchmark baselines
- Consider model size and architecture
- Account for evaluation methodology differences

### 3. Extensions
- Add more questions from same benchmarks
- Include additional benchmark sources
- Customize for specific domains
