{"conversation_id": "ctx_001", "context": "Alice has 5 apples. Bob gives her 3 more apples.", "question": "How many apples does Alice have now?", "response": "To find out how many apples Alice has after Bob gives her some, we simply add the number of apples she already had to the number that Bob gave her. So, if Alice started with 5 apples and then received an additional 3 from Bob, we calculate:\n\n\n5 (Alice'ths original apples) + 3 (Bob\u2019s gifted apples) = 8 apples in total.\n\n\nTherefore, Alice now has 8 apples.", "gold_answer": "8", "exact_match": 0, "context_similarity": 0.6665355417529331}

Today, he saw 12 patients in the morning and 8 patients in the afternoon.", "question": "How many patients did John see today?", "response": "To find out how many patients Dr. John saw today, we simply need to add the number of patients he saw in the morning to the number of patients he saw in the afternoon. So, if he saw 12 patients in the morning and added another 8 in the afternoon, then:\n\n\nMorning Patients + Afternoon Patients = Total Patients Today\n\n12 + 8 = 20\n\n\nTherefore, Drener John saw a total of 20 patients today.", "gold_answer": "20", "exact_match": 0, "context_similarity": 0.6665355417529331}
{"conversation_id": "ctx_003", "context": "To make a cake, you need 2 cups of flour, 1 cup of sugar, and 3 eggs. You have 6 cups of flour, 4 cups of sugar, and 9 eggs.", "question": "How many cakes can you make with these ingredients?", "response": "To determine the maximum number of cakes that can be made from given quantities of ingredients without any leftovers, we need to find out which ingredient will run out first when making as many full batches (cakes) as possible. This is essentially a problem about finding the limiting reactant in chemistry but applied here for baking purposes:\n\n- Flour needed per cake = 2 cups, available flour = 6 cups => Number of cakes that can be made with just enough flour = 6/2 = 3 cakes.\n- Sugar needed per cake = 1 cup, available sugar = 4 cups => Number of cakes that can be made with just enough sugar = 4/1 = 4 cakes.\n- Eggs needed per cake = 3 eggs, available eggs = 9 eggs => Number of cakes that can be made with just enough eggs = 9/3 = 3 cakes.\n\nThe limiting reactant (or ingredient in this case) is the one which allows for the least number of batches to be prepared - here it's both flour and eggs, each allowing us to make only three full-size cakes without any leftovers. Therefore, you can bake a maximum of 3 whole cakes with these ingredients provided that no other constraints (like oven capacity) are in place.", "gold_answer": "3", "exact_match": 0, "context_similarity": 0.6665355417529331}
{"conversation_id": "ctx_004", "context": "A train leaves Station A at 2:00 PM traveling at 60 mph. Another train leaves Station B at 2:30 PM traveling at 80 mph toward Station A. The stations are 200 miles apart.", "question": "At what time will the two trains meet?", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate when both trains have covered a combined distance of 200 miles since they started moving towards each other from their respective starting points at Station A and B. The first train has been traveling for half an hour more than the second one; therefore, it covers some initial ground before the latter starts its journey.\n\n\nFirst Train's Distance Covered in Half Hour: 60 mph * 0.5 hours = 30 miles\n\nRemaining Distance to be Covered by Both Trains Together: 200 miles - 30 miles = 170 miles\n\nCombined Speed of Two Trains Moving Towards Each Other: 60 mph + 80 mph = 140 mph\n\nTime for the Remaining Distance to be Covered by Both Trains Together: 170 miles / 140 mph = 1.2143 hours (approximately)\n\nSince Train B started at 2:30 PM, they will meet approximately 1 hour and 13 minutes later, which is around 3:43 PM.", "gold_answer": "3:30 PM", "exact_match": 0, "context_similarity": 0.6665355417529331}

She paid with a $20 bill.", "question": "How much change did Sarah receive?", "response": "To find out how much change Sarah received, we need to subtract the total amount she spent from the amount she gave to the cashier. The cost of the book and pen together is $15 + $3 = $18. Since she paid with a $20 bill, her change would be $20 - $18 = $2. Therefore, Sarah received $2 in change.", "gold_answer": "2", "exact_match": 0, "context_similarity": 0.6665355417529331}
