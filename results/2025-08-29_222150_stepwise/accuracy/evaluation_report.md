### Question 1: acc_001

**Question**: Janet's dogs eat 2 pounds of dog food each day. Janet has 5 dogs. How many pounds of dog food does Janet need to feed her dogs for 30 days?

**Model Response**: 
```
To find out how much dog food Janet needs for all five dogs, we first calculate the daily consumption:

2 pounds/dog * 5 dogs = 10 pounds per day.

Then, multiply this by the number of days in a month to get the total amount needed:

10 pounds/day * 30 days = 300 pounds for one month's supply. Answer: \boxed{300}.


```

**Expected Answer**: 300

**Score**: 1.000
