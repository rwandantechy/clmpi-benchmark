# CLMPI Benchmark Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive benchmarking strategy for implementing the Comprehensive Language Model Performance Index (CLMPI) framework. The plan establishes systematic evaluation procedures for assessing LLM performance across the five core dimensions: Accuracy, Contextual Understanding, Coherence, Fluency, and Resource Efficiency.

## Benchmarking Objectives

1. **Standardized Evaluation**: Establish consistent evaluation protocols across different LLM models
2. **Comprehensive Assessment**: Evaluate models across all CLMPI dimensions
3. **Comparative Analysis**: Enable direct comparison between different LLM architectures
4. **Reproducible Results**: Ensure benchmark results are reproducible and verifiable
5. **Scalable Framework**: Design framework that can accommodate new models and tasks

## Evaluation Framework

### Phase 1: Dataset Preparation
- **Accuracy Datasets**: Curated question-answer pairs with expert-verified responses
- **Contextual Understanding**: Multi-turn conversations and document-based queries
- **Coherence Evaluation**: Long-form text generation and logical reasoning tasks
- **Fluency Assessment**: Text quality evaluation datasets
- **Efficiency Testing**: Standardized prompts for resource measurement

### Phase 2: Model Integration

- **Local Model Support**: Support for locally hosted models (LLaMA, etc.)
- **Batch Processing**: Efficient handling of multiple evaluation tasks
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for API failures and timeouts

### Phase 3: Evaluation Execution
