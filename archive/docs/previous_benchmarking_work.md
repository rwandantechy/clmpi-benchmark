# Previous Benchmarking Work (v2)

## Overview

This document describes the systematic v2 benchmarking workflow that was conducted prior to implementing the CLMPI framework. This work established the foundation for mathematical accuracy testing and performance evaluation of open-source language models.

## V2 Benchmarking Methodology

### Models Evaluated

The v2 workflow systematically tested the following models:

**Core Models (Primary Focus):**
- **tinyllama**: Lightweight model for edge deployment
- **phi3:mini**: Microsoft's efficient language model
- **gemma:2b**: Google's compact model
- **mistral**: High-performance open-source model

**Extended Model Set:**
- llama3.1-latest
- codellama-latest
- llava-7b
- notux-8x7b
- orca-mini-latest

### Mathematical Accuracy Testing

**Test Framework:**
- **4 Standard Quadratic Equations** with known answers
- **Equation Types Covered:**
  1. **Distinct Real Roots**: Standard quadratic with two different real solutions
  2. **Repeated Real Roots**: Perfect square trinomial
  3. **Complex Roots**: Quadratic with negative discriminant
  4. **Irrational Roots**: Quadratic with non-perfect square discriminant

**Evaluation Process:**
1. Pull model into Dockerized Ollama environment
2. Run accuracy benchmark script
3. Test each model on all 4 math questions
4. Automatically check correctness against known answers
5. Measure performance metrics simultaneously

### Performance Metrics Collected

**Quantitative Measurements:**
- **Response Time**: End-to-end processing latency
- **CPU Usage**: Processor utilization during inference
- **RAM Consumption**: Memory footprint tracking
- **Accuracy Rate**: Percentage of correct mathematical solutions

### Results and Visualizations

**Data Collection:**
- Results recorded to CSV files (`llm_accuracy_results.csv`)
- Individual model output files (`.md` format)
- Performance metrics for each evaluation

**Visualization Generation:**
- Accuracy dashboards for each model
- Comparative analysis charts
- Performance correlation plots
- Summary statistics and rankings

## Integration with CLMPI Framework

### Complementary Approaches

The v2 benchmarking work and CLMPI framework provide complementary evaluation perspectives:

| Aspect | V2 Benchmarking | CLMPI Framework |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Focus** | Mathematical accuracy | Comprehensive cognitive assessment |
| **Scope** | 4 specific equations | Multiple evaluation axes |
| **Metrics** | Accuracy + Performance | 5-dimensional scoring |
| **Models** | 9 models tested | Extensible to any Ollama model |
| **Environment** | Dockerized | Native Ollama integration |

### Evolution Path

1. **V2 Work**: Established mathematical reasoning baseline
2. **CLMPI Framework**: Expanded to comprehensive evaluation
3. **Future Integration**: Combine both approaches for complete assessment

### Key Insights from V2 Work

**Mathematical Reasoning Capabilities:**
- Model performance varies significantly on complex mathematical tasks
- Smaller models (tinyllama, phi3:mini) show trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency
- Mistral demonstrates strong balance of accuracy and performance

**Performance Characteristics:**
- Response time correlates with model size and complexity
- Memory usage patterns differ significantly between model families
- CPU utilization varies based on model architecture

**Edge Deployment Considerations:**
- Smaller models (gemma:2b, phi3:mini) suitable for resource-constrained environments
- Larger models (mistral, llama3.1) provide better accuracy at cost of resources
- Trade-off analysis essential for deployment decisions

## Technical Implementation

### Docker Environment
```yaml
# docker-compose.yml structure
services:
  ollama:
    image: ollama/ollama
    ports:
      - "11434:11434"
    volumes:
      - ollama_data:/root/.ollama
```

### Benchmarking Scripts
- `accuracy_benchmark.py`: Core mathematical testing
- `analyze_accuracy_dashboard.py`: Visualization generation
- `analyze_llm.py`: Model-specific analysis
- `analyze_system.py`: Performance monitoring
